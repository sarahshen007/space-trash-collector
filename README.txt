Project Description
My project is a space trash game where one spawns in the orbit of a planet earth. 
The player must navigate around the planet, dodge orbiting moons and satellites,
all while collecting space trash via touching the space trash or colliding
the space trash with their spaceship.
At the beginning of the game, the player spawns facing the planet.
Moons, pieces of space trash, and satellites spawn, all orbiting the planet.
The camera is always focused on the space ship, panning using smoothdamp.
The player sees in front of the spaceship.
There is also a back camera, which the player may switch to by holding down
the camera button.
The spaceship constantly moves forward at a predetermined speed.
The player can move faster by pressing the thrust button, which they can only
press again after the initial thrust is over.
If the player collides with anything that isn't a piece of trash, an explosion
particle effect will play and the player will respawn at some location far from the 
collision location, facing towards the planet.
There are state messages that pop up, such as adding to score, "Out of Bounds",
and "Game Over."
If a player clicks on the wrong object, it turns red. Likewise, if they click on
a correct piece of trash, it turns green.

I promoted visibility of system status.
I used animations to indicate what is going on, as well as popup text.
I matched between system and the real world.
I used icons that match the real world, such as the clock icon for the time 
remaining and the camera to indicate switching the camera button.
I also used a joystick to control the movement of the spaceship, because it
is intuitive to the player, since joysticks are used for navigation of 
planes in real life.
I also used user control and freedom.
If players want to reset the game after not having a good try, they are free to do
so using the reset button in the top right.
I ensured that I was consistent.
Animations are consistent, text is consistent, collisions all look and feel the same.
The UI is clear and minimalistic, intuitive to use.
